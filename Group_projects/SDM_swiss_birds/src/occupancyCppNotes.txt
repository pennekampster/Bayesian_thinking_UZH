occupancy.cpp notes:

* added src folder - good practice for organizing C++ code
* .cpp successfuly compiles
* After compilation, the computer will return a .dll and .o file of the same name. 
  These files are specific to your computer's operating system, so it is recommended 
  not to push them to gitHub. You will need to run a compilation step yourself in R
  using TMB::compile('occupancy.cpp')
* The J vector tallies the number of reps per site, which then defines the size of the
  inner loop on line 25. This is similar to what Gesa's JAGS code was doing with nsites.
* k is an accumulated index and replaces the need for the siteID index 
* Question: is the knownOcc vector redundant or is this a special identifier for higher certainty obs?
