A single species extinction can cause a chain of secondary extinctions leading to a trophic cascade in a food web [@dunneCascadingExtinctionsCommunity2009]. Hence, it is important to improve our predictive understanding of the causes and consequences of biodiversity loss in an ecosystem. Knowing the reason behind species extinction can help us improve conservation efforts. 

The order in which species go extinct in a food web influences the consequences of the extinction event. For example, loss of larger species first, followed by smaller species, can cause a more rapid loss of ecosystem functioning in marine sediments than a random extinction order, according to simulation-based predictions [@solanExtinctionEcosystemFunction2004]. Therefore, other than knowing which species might suffer extinction, it is also crucial to know when the species will go extinct.

Species in a community are linked by a complex network of interactions such as competition, predation and mutualisms. This can result in the extinction of one species caused by the loss of other species [@paineFoodWebComplexity1966]. Species extinction can also be influenced by abiotic environmental factors [@cardilloMultipleCausesHigh2005].

In this project, we would like to study the effect of environmental factors and interspecific interactions on the extinction rates of species in an experimental microbial aquatic community composed of 17 protist species. In the experiment, four different treatment combinations had been used, varying temperature and nutrient concentration in the microcosms. We would like to investigate the combined effect of interspecific interactions and environmental factors on the determinants of extinction events.

We will use survival analysis with a Bayesian approach to estimate the mean extinction times (MTEs) of the species. Possible research questions of this project are:

* What would be the effect of using informative priors derived from empirical studies or elicited from experts for the parameters of the model?

* How can we change the survival model presented here to make them more realistic/interesting than the preliminary study below?

* How extinction times distributions differ among the 17 species of the community?

* What is the effect of the different treatments (eg temperature and nutrient concentration) on the MTE of the different species?

* How can we take into account species traits (eg body size) and food web structure in the analysis?

* What is the effect of species interactions and/or environmental factors on the collapse of this little ecological community?


# Aquatic food web 

The aquatic food web consists of a 17 taxa of aquatic eukaryotic microorganisms, unknown heterotrophic nanoflagellates and an unknown bacterial flora (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig1)). The species in the food web (Fig. \@ref(fig:fig1)) are: 3 *Blepharisma japonicum*, 4 *Chilomonas paramecium*, 5 *Colpidium striatum*, 6 *Colpoda cucculus*, 7 *Cyclidium glaucoma*, 8 *Didinium nasutum*, 9 *Dileptus anser*, 10 *Entosiphon*, 11 *Euplotes patella*, 12 *Loxocephallus*, 13 *Lepadella*, 14 *Dicanophoridae*, 15 *Paramecium bursaria*, 16 *Paramecium caudatum*, 17 *Telotrochiudium*, 18 *Tetrahymena piriformis* and 19 *Vorticella*.

# Dataset

The experiment for the current dataset was conducted by Nicholas Worsfold at the University of Sheffield [@worsfoldConsequencesExtinctionExperimental2007].
The data is from a highly replicated microcosm experiment where the extinction times of freshwater protists species forming a small food web was recorded. Four different treatment combinations have been used, varying temperature and nutrient concentration in the microcosms. 

The raw data from the experiment provides the presence or absence of each species for each of the eight weeks of the experiment, for each of the 200 replicates. 
We cleaned the data removing Lazarus effects (species recorded as extinct and then found again in a subsequent week), and we present the last week at which the species was observed present in the microcosm.

# Preliminary study using a subset of the dataset

Below, we subset the dataset one species *P. bursaria*. We fit a simple survival model using a Bayesian approach, to compute The Mean Time to Extinction for the Species, considering all experimental treatments.

## Survival model with exponential distribution

The probability for a species with extinction rate $\lambda$ to survive until time $t$ is given by the exponential
\begin{equation}
S(t,\lambda)=e^{-\lambda t}
\end{equation}
Thus, the probability of the species to go extinct within time interval $[t_{i-1},t_i]$ (measured in weeks) is given by
\begin{equation}
p_i(\lambda)=S(t_{i-1},\lambda)-S(t_i,\lambda)
\end{equation}
Assume that the species we considered has the same extinction rate in all the $N=200$ replicates we have. 
We want to calculate the probability (the likelihood) that the species goes extinct in $y_1$ replicates during the time interval $[t_0, t_1]$, in $y_2$ replicates during the time interval $[t_2, t_3]$ etc. 
Those replicates where the species survives for the whole experiment (which lasts $n=8$ weeks) are assumed to go extinct during the interval $[t_n, \infty]$, and this happens with probability $p_{n} = S(t_n)$. 
Due to the independence of the extinction process in the different replicates, the counts of the exinction events durig the different time intervals $(y_1,\cdots,y_n)$ are assumed to be independent and therefore the probability for observing such counts is then simply given by the product
\begin{equation}
p_1^{y_1}(\lambda) \cdot p_2^{y_2}(\lambda) \cdot \cdots p_{n}^{y_n}(\lambda).
\end{equation}
Since we do not distinguish replicates, we have to multiply this product by a so-called
multinomial coefficient, which counts the number of ways to put $N$ individuals into $n+1$
buckets, with $n_1$ ending up in the first bucket, $n_2$ in the second etc. Thus, the likelihood function, for model parameter $\lambda$, given an output ${\bf y}$ of our survival model, is described by the so called multinomial distribution
\begin{equation}
L_{\mathrm{survival}}(\lambda,{\bf y})=\frac{N!}{y_1!\cdots y_{n+1}!}p_1^{y_1}(\lambda) \cdot p_2^{y_2}(\lambda) \cdot \cdots p_{n}^{y_n}(\lambda)
\end{equation}
We will use this likelihood function to compute the extinction rate $\lambda$ for the selected species in a Bayesian framework, using univariate lognormal priors on the extinction rate.

Note that in JAGS, the lognormal distribution is parameterized using the mean $m$ and and precision $\tau = 1/s^2$ of its normally distributed logarithm. Therefore, to get a lognormally distributed extinction rate $\lambda \sim LN(\mu_{\lambda},\sigma_{\lambda})$, with mean $\mu_{\lambda}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\lambda}$, we will use the conversion formulas given by
\begin{equation}
    m = log(\mu_{\lambda})-\frac{\sigma^2_{\lambda}}{2}, \; \;  s=\sqrt{\frac{log(1+\sigma^2_{\lambda})}{\mu^2_{\lambda}}},
\end{equation}
for the mean and standard deviation respectively.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Let's subset the dataset for the species we considered Paramecium bursaria
spp.dd <- subset(dd, species==all.species[ss])

## define a JAGS object for our model

## define the number of iterations of the Markov Chain
sampsize <- 10000

## transform the data to get the counts of the extinction events

data.survival.frame           <- data.frame(matrix(ncol=3,nrow=8,0))
colnames(data.survival.frame) <- c("var","t","data")



#### count the extinction events during the different weeks
ww <- 1

## time intervals
## note that we set t=1000 for the replicates where the species survived
t <- c(0,data.survival.frame$t,1000)

## write JAGS model definition file:
cat("model {\n",
    "  mulog_lambda <- log(mu_lambda)-0.5*sdlog_lambda^2\n",
    "  sdlog_lambda <- sqrt(log(1+sd_lambda^2/mu_lambda^2))\n",
    "  lambda ~ dlnorm(mulog_lambda,1/sdlog_lambda^2)\n",
    "  for ( i in 1:n ) {\n",
    "    p[i] <- exp(-lambda*t[i])-exp(-lambda*t[i+1])\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  y ~ dmulti(p,N)\n",
    "}\n",
    sep="",
    file=file.jags.model)

### Note how we transformed the mean and sd of the prior.

## run JAGS:
jags.obj <- jags.model(file.jags.model,
                       data=list(mu_lambda = 0.2, ### mean of the prior
                                 sd_lambda = 0.2, ### standard deviation of the prior
                                 n         = nrow(data.survival.frame)+1,
                                 N         = sum(y),
                                 t         = t,
                                 y         = y))


## extract and plot results:
jags.res <- coda.samples(jags.obj,c("lambda"),sampsize)
plot(jags.res)

## compute and plot the distribution of the inferred Mean time to extinction
MTE <- 1/as.matrix(jags.res)
hist(MTE,main="MTE",xlab="time (weeks)")

## COMPARE THIS RESULT WITH THE PLOTS OBTAINED BEFORE
