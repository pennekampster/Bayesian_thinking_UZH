  abstract = {It is suggested that local animal species diversity is related to the number of predators in the system and their efficiency in preventing single species from monopolizing some important, limiting, requisite. In the marine rocky intertidal this requisite usually is space. Where predators capable of preventing monopolies are missing, or are experimentally removed, the systems become less diverse. On a local scale, no relationship between latitude (10⚬ to 49⚬ N.) and diversity was found. On a geographic scale, an increased stability of annual production may lead to an increased capacity for systems to support higher-level carnivores. Hence tropical, or other, ecosystems are more diverse, and are characterized by disproportionately more carnivores.},

  abstract = {Species loss in ecosystems can lead to secondary extinctions as a result of consumer–resource relationships and other species interactions. We compare levels of secondary extinctions in communities generated by four structural food-web models and a fifth null model in response to sequential primary species removals. We focus on various aspects of food-web structural integrity including robustness, community collapse and threshold periods, and how these features relate to assumptions underlying different models, different species loss sequences and simple measures of diversity and complexity. Hierarchical feeding, a fundamental characteristic of food-web structure, appears to impose a cost in terms of robustness and other aspects of structural integrity. However, exponential-type link distributions, also characteristic of more realistic models, generally confer greater structural robustness than the less skewed link distributions of less realistic models. In most cases for the more realistic models, increased robustness and decreased levels of web collapse are associated with increased diversity, measured as species richness               S               , and increased complexity, measured as connectance               C               . These and other results, including a surprising sensitivity of more realistic model food webs to loss of species with few links to other species, are compared with prior work based on empirical food-web data.},

  abstract = {Predicting the consequences of extinction is an important goal in ecology, due to the accelerating rate of global and local species loss. Cascading extinction\textasciitilde{} the extinction of one species as a consequence of the extinction of another, has been demonstrated in several natural ecosystems and is widely predicted by theoretical studies. Extinction may also affect the functioning of ecosystems, as functionally important species may be lost from communities and positive interactions between species may be disrupted. Investigating the consequences of extinction in natural ecosystems is difficult, as removing a species from an area of habitat is often problematic. Also, because indirect effects may take many generations to be revealed, experimental manipulations in natural ecosystems often need to last for several years. Experimental aquatic microcosms provide a new opportunity for conducting removal experiments in small, tractable, communities containing rapidly reproducing species. Here, I present the results of four experiments conducted in such microcosms that . investigated the consequences of the removal ofa species and the effect of temperature and energy on patterns ofextinction. In general, local diversity was robust to the removal of a species. No cascading extinction was observed and some positive effects of extinction for diversity were revealed. Species loss had a positive, negative or no effect on ecosystem functioning, depending upon community composition. Small changes to the identity of the species present in communities had large effects; the consequences of extinction for . . ecosystem functioning was very context-dependent and rare species were important. Temperature and chemical energy interacted to determine species diversity and extinction determinism, making it difficult to predict the consequences of changes to either temperature or chemical energy for extinction without knowledge of the other.},
